# Space Invader ðŸ‘¾

This is the classic arcade video game, where players control a laser cannon positioned at the bottom of the screen and must defend the Earth from descending waves of alien invaders. The player's objective is to shoot down as many aliens as possible while avoiding their projectiles. As the game progresses, the aliens move closer to the player, increasing the difficulty.
